== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an API key? =

Yes, you'll need either a Google Gemini API key or an OpenAI API key. The plugin provides detailed instructions on how to get these for free.

= Which AI provider should I choose? =

We recommend Google Gemini as it offers a generous free tier and faster response times. However, both providers work excellently.

= Are API keys secure? =

Yes, API keys are stored securely in your WordPress database and are never exposed to website visitors or included in any frontend code.

= Can I customize the summary appearance? =

Yes, the summaries use CSS classes that you can style in your theme. The default styling is clean and responsive.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No, summaries are generated in the background when posts are saved. Visitors see cached summaries, so there's no impact on loading speed.

Yes, each post has a checkbox in the editor to enable/disable summaries individually.

= Does it work with all themes? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to work with any WordPress theme. Summaries are added to the content automatically.

Yes, you can use the [ai_post_summary] shortcode to place summaries anywhere in your content.

Your summaries are preserved in the database. If you reactivate the plugin, everything will work as before.

= Is there a word/character limit? =

You can set your preferred character count in the settings. The default is 200 characters, but you can adjust this as needed.
